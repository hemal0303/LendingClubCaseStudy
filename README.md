## General Information
- **Project Overview**: The objective of this project is to analyze Lending Club's loan data to understand the driving factors behind loan defaults. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, we aim to identify the key variables that are associated with higher default risk.
- **Business Problem**: Lending Club wants to reduce the risk of loan defaults. By understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults, the company can optimize its risk assessment process and make more informed lending decisions.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project consists of historical loan data from Lending Club, including borrower details, loan amounts, interest rates, terms, and loan statuses (Fully Paid, Charged Off, etc.).

## Conclusions
1. **Loan Amount & Interest Rate Interaction**: Higher loan amounts with high-interest rates are associated with a higher likelihood of default, making this a key risk factor.
2. **Home Ownership**: Renters and individuals with lower homeownership status show a higher tendency for loan defaults compared to homeowners.
3. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**: A higher DTI ratio is a weak indicator but still shows a slight increase in default risk.
4. **Loan Purpose & Term**: Small business loans and longer loan terms (60 months) have a significantly higher charge-off rate, indicating higher default risk.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - version 3.8
- **Pandas** - version 1.3.3 (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** - version 3.4.3 (for visualizations)
- **Seaborn** - version 0.11.2 (for advanced visualizations)
